\section{Introduction and modelling}
% Explanation of the problem and modelling.
In this APP we have to deal with a card game played by two persons.
One player is referred to as sister, the other player is referred to as strategist.
A series of n cards lying on the table face up in a line. We are modelling
the card deck through a \gls{deque}, short deque. The elments of the deque are integers
in the range of [2, 14], whereas the value 2 represents the card 2 and the
value 14 represents the value of an ace. All values in between are assigned
appropriately, this means in particular for the face cards that the jack
is modeled by 11, the queen by 12 and the king by 13.
The deque allows according to the game rules to take only the
rightmost or the leftmost card. The players take turns while playing the
game and always decide to take the leftmost or rightmost card. This is
modeled through \gls{popleft} to take leftmost card and through \gls{pop}
to take the rightmost card. Be careful, the naming of \gls{pop} for taking
the rightmost card can be considered not consistent with \gls{popleft}, but we
stick to the denotation of the phyton standard library. The player with
the highest score in the end wins. Even though we will apply different
algorithms to solve the problem, the input and ouput of the algorithm stays the same.
%% TODO change this section if input or ouput should be different
The input is a list of cards represented as deque and the choice (of the sister)
who starts the game represented as boolean. The output is 0 if the sister wins
or the sum of the players are equal. The output is 1 if the
player strategist wins.\\

In this APP we decided to change to phyton code for representing algorithms.
The reason for this is that phyton code has a simple structure and resembles
pseudocode in a way. But furthermore it allows us to represent the developed
algorithms more detailed.\\

The sister will always play the so called \gls{greedy}. Therefore we first consider
an algorithm applying this method in chapter 2. Because of some limitations
of the \gls{greedy} we will then consider a complete solution space exploration
in chapter 3. This gives us an optimal solution, but with an unacceptable runtime.
For this reason we will introduce a dynamic algorithm in chapter 4, resulting
in an optimal solution with acceptable runtime.
